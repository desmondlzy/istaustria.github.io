bio: |
  I am now a researcher in the MFX Team at Inria Nancy in France (https://mfx.loria.fr/). I was a postdoc researcher at IST Austria in [Chris Wojtan Group](https://pub.ista.ac.at/~wojtan/) between 2016 and 2020. I am interested in physics-based simulation and modeling natural phenoma as well as geometric modeling. I obtained my PhD in 2016 at the University of Grenoble-Alpes, supervised by Stefanie Hahmann and Damien Rohmer of the Imagine Team. I got an Engenieering Degree in 2013 from the school ENSIMAG (Grenoble INP) of Grenoble, France.
