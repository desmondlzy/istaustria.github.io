bio: |
  I got my MSc in Computer Science in 2009 from the Jagiellonian University in Cracow, Poland. Then I obtained a PhD in 2015 at the AGH University of Science and Technology in Cracow. Currently I am a postdoc researcher in [Chris Wojtan's group](https://pub.ista.ac.at/~wojtan/). My research interests include physics-based simulations, multiobjective optimization and evolutionary algorithms.
