bio:
  I obtained my PhD. in November 2014 at [Rey Juan Carlos University](http://www.urjc.es/) under the supervision of [Miguel A. Otaduy](http://www.gmrv.es/~motaduy/). I worked on modeling and estimation of hyperelasticity and deformation models. Currently, I focus on physically-based simulation (including data-driven approaches) and its application to computational design and digital fabrication.
