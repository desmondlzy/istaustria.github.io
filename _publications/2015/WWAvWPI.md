abstract: |
  We present an efficient wavefront tracking algorithm for animating 
  bodies of water that interact with their environment. Our contributions 
  include: a novel wavefront tracking technique that enables dispersion, 
  refraction, reflection, and diffraction in the same simulation; 
  a unique multivalued function interpolation method that enables our 
  simulations to elegantly sidestep the Nyquist limit; a dispersion 
  approximation for efficiently amplifying the number of simulated 
  waves by several orders of magnitude; and additional extensions that 
  allow for time-dependent effects and interactive artistic editing of 
  the resulting animation. Our contributions combine to give us 
  multitudes more wave details than similar algorithms, while 
  maintaining high frame rates and allowing close camera zooms.
