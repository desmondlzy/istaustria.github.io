abstract: |
  We study the problem of predicting the future, though
  only in the probabilistic sense of estimating a future state
  of a time-varying probability distribution. This is not only
  an interesting academic problem, but solving this extrapolation
  problem also has many practical application, e.g. for
  training classifiers that have to operate under time-varying
  conditions.
  Our main contribution is a method for predicting the next
  step of the time-varying distribution from a given sequence
  of sample sets from earlier time steps. For this we rely on
  two recent machine learning techniques: embedding probability
  distributions into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space,
  and learning operators by vector-valued regression.
  We illustrate the working principles and the practical
  usefulness of our method by experiments on synthetic and
  real data. We also highlight an exemplary application:
  training a classifier in a domain adaptation setting without
  having access to examples from the test time distribution at
  training time.
