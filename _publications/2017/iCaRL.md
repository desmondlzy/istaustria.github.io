abstract: |
        A major open problem on the road to artificial intelligence is 
        the development of incrementally learning systems that learn
        about more and more concepts over time from a stream of data. 
        In this work, we introduce a new training strategy, iCaRL, that 
        allows learning in such a class-incremental way: only the training 
        data for a small number of classes has to be present at the same 
        time and new classes can be added progressively. iCaRL learns 
        strong classifiers and a data representation simultaneously. 
        This distinguishes it from earlier works that were fundamentally 
        limited to fixed data representations and therefore incompatible 
        with deep learning architectures. We show by experiments on 
        CIFAR-100 and ImageNet ILSVRC 2012 data that iCaRL can learn 
        many classes incrementally over a long period of time where 
        other strategies quickly fail.
