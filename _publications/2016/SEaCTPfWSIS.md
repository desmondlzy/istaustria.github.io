abstract: |
        We introduce a new loss function for the weakly-supervised
        training of semantic image segmentation models based on three guiding
        principles: to seed with weak location cues, to expand objects based on
        the information about which classes can occur, and to constrain the segmentations
        to coincide with image boundaries. We show experimentally
        that training a deep convolutional neural network using the proposed
        loss function leads to substantially better segmentations than previous
        state-of-the-art methods on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset.
        We furthermore give insight into the working mechanism of our method
        by a detailed experimental study that illustrates how the segmentation
        quality is affected by each term of the proposed loss function as well as
        their combinations.
